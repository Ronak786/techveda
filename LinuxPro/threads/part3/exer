1. write a program that computes sum of an int array of size 1000. Engage 4 threads  to 
   process array faster.

  Note: 1. implement main thread to compute the final result
	
  Task1: Acheive result using barrier sync
  Task2: Acheive result without applying barrier

2. write a program which engages two threads to print offsets of an array
   Implement first thread to print even offsets and other thread to print odd
   offsets

   TaskNote: use barrier to acheive sync.
