1. write a test case to verify if signal handlers are shared by parent and
   child process. Check if sighand list of parent is shared under COW.


2. write a test case to verify if blocked sigmask is shared by parent and child   process created using fork().

	step 1: mask(block) few signals using sigprocmask api
	step 2: create a child process using fork()
	step 3: put child into inifinite loop

   generate masked signals to child process and observe response.

3. Impelement a program that shows current clock time every minute on terminal
   through signal handler

	step 1: register for a periodic timer at 1 minute resloution
	step 2: Register signal handler to respond to timer signal
	step 3: get current time and print to console from signal handler
	
   Refer: # man 2 setitimer
	  # man   ctime
	  # man 2 time

4. verify if active timers of parent are shared by child process created 
   using fork().

5. Impelement a program that shows current clock time every minute on terminal
   through using posix real time timer interface

        step 1: register for a periodic timer at 1 minute resloution
        step 2: Register signal handler to respond to timer signal
        step 3: get current time and print to console from signal handler

   Refer: # man 2 timer_create
          # man 2 timer_settime
          # man 2 sigaction
